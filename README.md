# BashDatDash Chrome Extension

BashDatDash is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to enhance your ChatGPT experience by replacing em-dashes (U+2014) and en-dashes (U+2013) in responses with a user-selected character or string (default: comma + space).

## Features

- **Automatic Dash Replacement:** Replaces em-dashes and/or en-dashes in streamed and initial ChatGPT text.
- **Clipboard Integration:** Modifies copied text to reflect your chosen dash replacements.
- **Customizable Settings:** Easily configure **which** dash types to replace and the replacement string via a simple popup UI.
- **Zero Overhead When Disabled:** The extension consumes no measurable runtime resources when turned off.
